# battleship

This project is a web version of the classic game of Battleship. 

To play the game, you fist place your ships on the board. Once that is complete, the game starts and players take turns to select a cell on the opponent's board to shoot. If it's a hit, it'll be marked as red, and if it's a miss, it'll be marked as grey. Once one of the players sinks the other player's entire ship fleet, the game ends and the winner is announced.

## Motivation

I built this application as part of The Odin Project's required assignments. This project was intended to give me practice with tools like jest, babel, and npm, as they are tools that are handy in the job market, and helps make me a better developer.

## How to use?

Just open the github pages for this repository, and enjoy playing!
